# Multifunctional LLM Assistant for Discord

## Dependencies Installation
We will use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) in this project. Please visit the link to install poetry on your local machine.

After successfully installing Poetry, use the following command to install the project dependencies:

```
poetry install
```

This command will create a Python virtual environment and install all the required dependencies into that environment.

To activate the Python environment, run:

```
poetry shell
```

When youâ€™re done working in the virtual environment, simply type:

```
exit
```
